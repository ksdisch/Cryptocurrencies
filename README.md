# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to use the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) unsupervised machine learning techniques/algorithms to create an analysis of relevant cryptocurrencies. Pandas was used to preprocess the data so that it could be used effectively in both the K-means and PCA portions of the analysis. Finally, Plotly Express and hvplot was used to visualize the distinct groups that corresponded to the principal components created during the PCA portion. A table was also created with hvplot for further visualization.
